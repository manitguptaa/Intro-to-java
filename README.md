## Intro to Java
A java program can characterized as an **object** represented in a **class**.
Currently our program has a *Main* object. Inside of the object we have the *Main* class.

## Output
In Java to output an item to the console we use: 'System.out.print()' and 'System.out.print()'
'System.out.print()' jus prints out the statement and moves to the next line, while 'System.out.print()'just prints the statement.



## Comments
A comment is used as user annotation with the purpose of being human readable.


**Line Comments** follow double backslahes. `//` (Single Line Comment)


**Block Comments** are contained within `/* Comments */` (Multiple Lines Comment)




## Identifiers
In Java use the term **Identifier** to describe a variable, parameter, constant, user-defined method or user-defined class.
- Cannot begin with digit
- Can only contain ketts, numbers, or underscores
- Case sensitive /* age != Age /* 

*Note: *
- class name starts with a capital letter
- reserved words are entierly lowercase and may not be used as identifiers

## Types
**Primitive** or **built-in** types in Java are
- `int` An integer
- `boolean` True or False (boolean shirtColor = true)
- `double` floating-point number (2.73)
- `char` single character

## Variables 
Variables are a type of identifiers that stores a value of a specific type

We can create variables using **declaration**
- `int` age;`
- `double x, y;`
- `boolean found;`
- `char letter;`

We can also initialize a variable in its **declaration** 
- `int count = 1;`
- `double p = 3.14;`
- `char c = '8';`

## Chars
[ASCII CHART]


Each character is assiociated with an ASCII value.

## Type cast

One type can be cast to another compatible type if a part of type cast.

`char letter - 'c';`


int total, n;
double average;
average = (double)total/n //total/n //total cast to double to 
division is used
